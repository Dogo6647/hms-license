# hms-license
The HTLabs Modifiable Software (HMS) licenses for open-source software, created by HyperTextedLabs. Free for anyone to use or include in their projects. <br>

It is partially based on the zLib license and aims to provide a balance between freedom and control.

## About v1 (key points)
### 💵 Commercial usage
**✅ Allowed:**
> I am the original author, and I have a special paid version of my software. I am going to sell it.

> I am not the original author, but I want to include the original author's software in my paid software. <br> I promise to respect the conditions of the HMS license, release my changes to the source code, and credit the author properly.


**❌ Not allowed:**
> I'm not the original author; I made a fork of the original author's software and I'm going to directly profit off of it <br>by directly reselling the original author's work with changes I made as a standalone product (selling it by itself).

> I'm the original author of the software and I'm going to sell someone else's fork of my software.

**📦 In summary:**<br>
> You can bundle HMSv1-licensed software inside commercial software all you want just fine, but not sell it as a standalone product if you're not the original author. Basically, this license prevents individuals and entities from unfairly and directly profiting off of each others' work, while allowing said work to be commercially bundled as part of other original work and not as THE work with some changes.

### 🌎 Source disclosure
**✅ Allowed:**
> I'm a business who loves proprietary-ing everything and I made some changes to the original software's source, which is publicly available. I have released my changes to the source code to make them publicly available as well. I included the same license and copyright notice with my version.

> I'm using a modified version of the original software as an integrated backend helper in a proprietary API of mine. Since the software is only really used at my side, this counts as private use, and I do not need to release my modified software.


**❌ Not allowed:**
> I'm a business who loves proprietary-ing everything and I made some changes to the original software's source, which is publicly available. Too bad I didn't release my changes or credit the original author, I guess this software is mine now!

> I made a fork of the original software, but I changed the license and I was too lazy to include the full copyright notice, so I just included the copyright date :P


**📦 In summary:**
> Always disclose the source code if the modified software is going to be released publicly, and don't forget to include the original copyright notice untouched, as well as the same HMS license.
