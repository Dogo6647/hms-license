This software is provided "as-is", without any express or implied
warranty. In no event will the authors be held liable for any damages
arising from the use of this software.


TERMINOLOGY
- Modifying entity: The individual or group of individuals modifying
  the original source code.
- Modified software: The software derived from the original authors'
  version of the software.
- Altered source versions: Used as an alias of "Modified software".
- Original author(s): Refers to the individual or entity that first created 
  and released the software under this license. This corresponds to the
  author stated in the above copyright notice, which may not be altered
  on modified software and/or its source.
- Commercial distribution: The act of distributing the software individually
  while requiring monetary payment to access it. This does not include
  "bundling" the software within other software.


CONDITIONS OF DISTRIBUTION
Private modifications to this software are fully unrestricted, as long as
individual usage of the software is not granted beyond the modifying 
entity. This means the modifying entity can use the privately-modified 
software source to perform their own operations with no restrictions
as long as usage of the modified software is kept "behind-the-scenes" and
not distributed per se as individual source code or within other software.

Public redistribution of this software, including within all other software, 
however, is subject to the following restrictions:

1. The origin of this software must not be misrepresented; the original
   authors reserve the right to claim it as their own. Altered source 
   versions must credit the original authors by keeping the above copyright
   notice complete and unaltered with NO exceptions.
2. Altered source versions must be plainly marked as such, and must not be
   misrepresented as being the original software.
3. Commercial distribution (as defined above) is strictly reserved to the 
   original authors and versions first distributed by them. Modified versions
   of the original software NOT created and released by the original authors 
   are not allowed to be commercially distributed as standalone products by any
   entity, including the original authors. This does not prohibit the software 
   from being included or bundled within larger commercial software.
4. All modified software distributed by modifying entities must include its 
   complete source code and be licensed under the same terms as this license, 
   including this license file in the source.
5. Use of trademarks belonging to the original authors in modified software 
   is subject to the original authors' decision; while this license does not
   strictly prohibit usage of said trademarks, the original authors reserve
   the right to prohibit usage if they desire to do so via a written notice.


VIOLATION NOTICE
Violation of any condition in this license automatically invalidates the 
rights granted herein. On invalidation, the violating entity must cease all 
public distribution of the modified software.
